## Zig Game Frameworks

https://github.com/JonSnowbd/slingworks
Discord Tag of creator: Aetherwind#8836
- missing a few things like gamepad support, but now has a wiki for basic tutorials, and an example game(in development) that shows how to use the various features
- Slingworks is a 2d Game Engine where you provide the types, and slingworks does all the leg work for generating an editor, and all the windowing/graphics for you, and organized into Entity based scenes that has serialization saving/loading managed for you.
- Note: currently recommened to use the dev branch instead of master

https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit
- bundled along with zig renderkit, seems to be focused on 2d graphics only
- uses SDL2 as its only (!) dependency.

https://github.com/prime31/zig-renderkit
- core library of zig-gamekit

Stephen Gutekanst (@slimsag#2321 on Discord) has been building an engine
website: https://hexops.com/mach
twitter: <https://twitter.com/slimsag>
github: <https://github.com/hexops/mach>
